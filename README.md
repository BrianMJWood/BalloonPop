I botched a tech test where I fumbled with the simple task of clicking on an element and increasing its font-size. I completed it afterward but it was too late!

Of course the experience got stuck in my head a bit, so I decided to make a small game out of clicking on things to make them bigger - Balloons!

TODO:

- Start the game with 0 balloons on the screen, and have them randomly added.
- Make all balloons start in a random location
- Make all balloons float up when they appear
- Adjust the balloon string positioning to match expanded sizes
